# Decision Dilemma Problem Solver #

**What is the project?** 

In life, we often have to pick tasks to do. Sometimes these tasks are of equal importance. 
How can we pick the right one to do first? 

There is no correct or better answer. 

So we might as well pick any of the equally difficulty-level tasks. 

Our project allows users to input tasks they want to do into a list that represents tasks at the same level of importance. 
Once completed, we can shuffle this list into a random order and return the pre-designated amount of tasks the user specified. 

This solves the decision dilemma problem!

To expand on this project, the user can input tasks into 'Most important', 'Mid important', and 'Least important' by using the friendly and simple to use graphical user interface. 

Bingo! 

Life has never been easier!!!
